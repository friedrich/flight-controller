# Hardware features

- :heavy_check_mark: Voltage regulator delivering 3.3 V to the ICs
- :x: Battery voltage monitor
  - Battery voltage monitor pin PA10 is not connected to a DAC.
- :heavy_check_mark: Pulse width modulated power supply of the main and tail rotor motors
- :x: Current monitor of the main and tail rotor motors
  - Pins PF0 and PF1 are not connected to any operational amplifiers. This makes
    current sensing inaccurate, since the shunt voltage is quite low. Pins
    connected to OPAMP1 are: PA1, PA3, PA7. Pins connected to OPAMP2 are PA7,
    PB0.
- :heavy_check_mark: PWM control of the swashplate servos
- :heavy_check_mark: Programming and debugging interface via SWD and SWO
- :heavy_check_mark: Linear acceleration sensor and gyroscope
- :x: GPS receiver
  - No usable signal from antenna.
  - There is no good return path for the antenna signal.
- :x: Radio module with support for BLE, LoRa, FLRC, GFSK and ranging
  - Untested.
  - There is no good return path for the antenna signal.
- :heavy_check_mark: RGB status indicator LED
- :heavy_check_mark: Overcurrent protection (fuse)

## Possible improvements

- Connect reset pins of other ICs to the microcontroller.
- Connect the SX1280 busy pin and multi-purpose digital I/O pins to the
  microcontroller.
- Add test points to GND, CS, SDI, SDO, SCK, RESET.
- Print version number on the PCB.
- Remove silk screen labels of small compenents.
- Make it possible to manually pull up the BOOT0 pin in case the firmware
  disrupts SWD communication.
- The top internal layer should be a ground plane to ensure a nice return path
  for the RF signal. Make a six layer board with layers: signal, ground, signal,
  power, signal, ground.

## TODO

Check if all timers support the required operations.
Increase shunt resistor to 50 mOhm?
Add capacitor parallel to shunt?
TIM15 and TIM16 do not work!
